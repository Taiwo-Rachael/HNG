# HNG TASKS REPOSITORY
This repository contains some of the tasks I undertook in the course of my internship at HNG Tech. Notebooks for three (3) projects can be found here.

# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE IRIS DATASET
The first project showcases an exploratory data analysis of the Iris dataset, carried out using Python.  Some interesting insights were drawn from 3 species of Iris flowers, the Iris Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor.
A box plot was used to show the distribution of the dataset, revealing outliers. Further analysis showed that the Setosa species have relatively smaller Petal and Sepal length and width than their Versicolor and Virginica counterparts, among other insights revealed. Check out the full project in the notebook.

# LAGOS STATE 2023 ELECTION OUTLIER POLLING UNITS DETECTION USING GEOSPATIAL DATA
The second dataset in this repository captures the analysis of Lagos State 2023 election with the aim of detecting outlier polling units, where the votes received by parties showed significant deviation from those of neighbouring polling units, suggesting irregularities in the process. The DBSCAN algorithm was used to cluster polling units within 1 km radius of one another as neighbours, forming 57 unique clusters. Z-score threshold was used to detect outliers. Checkout the full analysis process in the notebook.

# LAGOS STATE FLOOD PREDICTION 
The third project involved the prediction of the next likely date of flooding in Lagos State. The process involved the analysis of historical weather and rainfall data to uncover patterns resulting in flooding events. The best performing Machine Learning model, which was the Random Forest Classifier, was used to predict the next flooding date based on available weather forecast data. Checkout the full process of analysis and prediction in the notebook.
